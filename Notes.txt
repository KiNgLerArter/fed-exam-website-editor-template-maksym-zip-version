1. Component props interfaces:
  1.1. Redundant exports for component props as they're not used anywhere(breaks encapsulation)
  1.2. There's no need to make this prop types as separate interfaces, better to inline them
  1.3. "FC" is outdated just use direct typing
2. Components
  2.1. Redundant method creation instead of just inline func, separate methods should be created in one of this cases: u want to wrap them in "useCallback" or they're reused.
       In other cases methods should be inlined for this benefits: types inheritance(the types are taken from the component method u pass ur callback in), better readability
       as u don't have to jump from jsx to function implementation
3. File structure
  3.1. Barrel files are overused, in most cases barrel files are anti-pattern as they drastically make harder for vite/webpack to tree-shake the code. 
       They can be used only for public-API to separate modules
